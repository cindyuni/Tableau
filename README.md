# Tableau Side Projects Portfolio
This repository contains my personal Tableau side projects, created to explore data visualization, dashboard design, and data storytelling. Each project is based on publicly available datasets and is intended as a creative and analytical exercise.

## ðŸ“Š Current Project

### ðŸšŒ TFL Bus Safety (Makeover Monday)
An exploratory dashboard built using data from the [Makeover Monday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) project. The dataset focuses on bus safety incidents reported by Transport for London (TfL).

This project was completed as part of the [**Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization-tableau) course offered by **University of California, Davis** on Coursera.

- **Data**: `TFL Bus Safety.xlsx`
- **Tool**: Tableau Public
- **Focus**: Visualizing accident trends, identifying common incident types, and highlighting safety patterns over time.
- **Status**: In progress
- **Original data source**: [Makeover Monday -2018/W51: London Bus Safety Performance](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w51)
> This project is part of my hands-on practice to improve skills in working with time-series data, building interactive dashboards, and presenting safety-related metrics clearly and effectively.

## ðŸš§ More Projects Coming Soon
This space will grow as I continue experimenting with new datasets and ideas using Tableau. Stay tuned!
